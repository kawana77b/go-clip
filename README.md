# Clipboard for Go

## NOTE

This is the [Original Repository](https://github.com/atotto/clipboard) fork (BSD-3-Clause license), oriented by atotto.  
The differences from the original are a single command with the Cobra command,  
some code modifications by using the latest version of Go, and the addition of build settings.  
The name of the command has been changed to `go-clip`.

**Usage has been changed as follows:**

```
echo aaaaaaaaa | go-clip.exe copy
go-clip paste
```
